Privacy Policy for AuraRate

Welcome to AuraRate! This Privacy Policy explains how Sozen Software ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, shares, and protects information in relation to our mobile application AuraRate (the "Service"). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using AuraRate, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

**1. Information We Collect**

We may collect the following types of information:

   a. **Information You Provide Directly:**
      *   **Images:** When you use the Service to analyze a photo, you voluntarily upload images to our servers for processing. We aim to process these images and do not intend to store them长久 (long-term) after the analysis is complete, unless explicitly stated for features like a "History" functionality where you choose to save them.
      *   **Account Information (If Applicable):** If we introduce account creation features in the future (e.g., for saving history across devices or premium features), we may collect information such as your email address, username, or other identifiers you provide.
      *   **Payment Information (If Applicable):** If you make in-app purchases (e.g., for "diamonds" or premium features), your payment will be processed by the respective app store provider (Apple App Store or Google Play Store). We do not directly collect or store your full credit card information. We may receive transaction identifiers or confirmation of purchase from the app store providers.

   b. **Information Collected Automatically:**
      *   **Usage Data:** We may collect information about how you access and use the Service. This may include your device type, operating system, IP address (which may be used to infer general location), app version, dates and times of access, features used, and crash reports. This data is typically anonymized or aggregated.
      *   **Device Identifiers:** We may collect device-specific identifiers (such as a device ID or advertising ID) to help us understand usage patterns and improve the Service.
      *   **Cookies and Similar Technologies (If a Web Component is Used):** If AuraRate includes web-based components, we might use cookies or similar tracking technologies.

**2. How We Use Your Information**

We use the information we collect for various purposes, including:

   *   To provide, operate, and maintain the Service (e.g., to process your images for aura analysis).
   *   To improve, personalize, and expand the Service.
   *   To understand and analyze how you use the Service.
   *   To develop new products, services, features, and functionality.
   *   To process your in-app purchases and transactions.
   *   To communicate with you, either directly or through one of our partners, including for customer service, to provide you with updates and other information relating to the Service, and for marketing and promotional purposes (with your consent, where required).
   *   To detect and prevent fraud and ensure the security of our Service.
   *   For compliance purposes, including enforcing our Terms of Service, or other legal rights, or as may be required by applicable laws and regulations or requested by any judicial process or governmental agency.

**3. How We Share Your Information**

We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information in the following situations:

   *   **With Service Providers:** We may share your information with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents who perform services on our behalf, such as cloud hosting (for image processing), analytics, and payment processing. These service providers will only have access to your information to the extent necessary to perform their functions and are obligated to protect your information.
   *   **For AI Image Analysis:** The images you upload are sent to a third-party AI service provider (e.g., Google Gemini) for the sole purpose of generating the aura analysis. These providers have their own privacy policies regarding the data they process. We strive to use services that prioritize data security and have clear data handling practices.
   *   **For Legal Reasons:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).
   *   **To Protect Our Rights:** We may disclose information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
   *   **Business Transfers:** If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your information may be transferred. We will provide notice before your Personal Information is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.
   *   **With Your Consent:** We may share your information for other purposes with your explicit consent.

**4. Data Retention and Deletion**

   *   **Uploaded Images:** Our goal is to process images for analysis and not store them longer than necessary for providing the Service. If a "History" feature is implemented where you save results, the associated image (or a reference to it) will be stored until you delete the history entry or your account (if applicable).
   *   **Other Information:** We will retain other personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
   *   You can request the deletion of your data by contacting us at sozensoftware@gmail.com. Please note that we may need to retain certain information for legal or legitimate business purposes.

**5. Security of Your Information**

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect your personal information. However, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.

**6. Children's Privacy**

Our Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or a higher age threshold where applicable by local law). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us.

**8. International Data Transfers**

Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction.

Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.
